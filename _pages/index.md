# UNIVERSE-HPC

UNIVERSE-HPC will define a training curriculum framework â€“ spanning from undergraduate to continuing professional development level - for Research Software Engineers (RSEs) specializing in high performance computing (HPC).

This will provide clear routes to enable more people from a wide diversity of disciplines and backgrounds to obtain the skills and experience they require to have a successful RSE career: working within centers of excellence, RSE groups, and embedded in research groups. Together this will provide the skilled workforce required by the UK to harness large-scale computing as the UK prepares to exploit exascale. 

It will develop and pilot the curriculum and necessary course materials to underpin a professional training programme in RSE and HPC, supported by cohort- and community-building activities, acting as a knowledge integration hub for those with a stake in education and training for RSEs, including other ExCALIBUR projects, those extending Carpentries training for HPC and RSE, and existing and future initiatives in this area.
